Intro
=====

PocketScan lets you use your digital camera or camera phone as a scanner!
Great for copying receipts, books, notes, whiteboards and more. PocketScan lets you:

* Sort and rotate your images
* Crop your images to remove all the extra stuff that is not part of the page.
  Crop regions do not have to be rectangular, which is useful for bent
  or partially rotated pages
* Color level pictures that are mostly black and white text. This makes
  them much more suitable for printing by increasing their contrast
* Prints the final book or exports the whole project to a PDF file

How to compile
==============

Use CMake on the pocketscan.src directory. You will require:

 - CMake
